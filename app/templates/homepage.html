            Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Maisha (Ma-ee-sha) and <br>
            I’m a current student at Boston University. I plan on majoring <br>
            in Computer Science & Statistics and minoring in Economics. I’m <br>
            originally from New York City but love going to school in <br>
            Boston! In my free time I like baking, watching soccer, and <br>
            exploring the city.
